<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>To create delicious chocolate chip cookies, start by creaming together butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, followed by vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually blend the dry ingredients into the wet mixture. Fold in a generous amount of chocolate chips. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them evenly. Bake at 350째F (175째C) for 10-12 minutes until the edges are golden brown but the centers are still soft. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy these classic cookies with a cold glass of milk.</p>
