      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>To make rich and fudgy brownies, start by melting butter and dark chocolate together in a heatproof bowl set over simmering water. Allow the mixture to cool slightly before whisking in sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, and salt, then gently fold the dry ingredients into the chocolate mixture until just combined. Pour the batter into a greased and lined baking pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Bake at 350째F (175째C) for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares. Enjoy these decadent brownies with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a glass of cold milk.</p>
